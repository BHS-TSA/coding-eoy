# End Of Year Coding Challenge

1. FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
2. Factorial: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
3. Palindrome: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same backwards as forwards), and False otherwise.
4. Reverse a String: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.
5. Fibonacci: Write a function that generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1. For example, the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
